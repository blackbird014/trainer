## 1. Quick Overview of DNA and RNA

### DNA — Deoxyribonucleic Acid

* Role: Long-term storage of genetic information.
* Structure: Double helix, nucleotides A, T, C, G, complementary pairing (A–T, C–G).
* Location: Mostly nucleus.
* Stability: Very stable, used to store hereditary information.

### RNA — Ribonucleic Acid

* Role: Working copy of DNA instructions to make proteins.
* Structure: Single strand, nucleotides A, U, C, G (U replaces T).
* Location: Made in nucleus, functions in cytoplasm.
* Main types:

  * mRNA: messenger RNA
  * tRNA: transfer RNA
  * rRNA: ribosomal RNA

## 2. What is mRNA?

* Full Name: Messenger RNA
* Role: Carries instructions from DNA to ribosomes to build proteins.
* How it works:

  1. Transcription: RNA polymerase copies DNA into mRNA (U replaces T).
  2. mRNA travels to cytoplasm.
  3. Translation: Ribosomes read codons, tRNA brings amino acids, protein is built.

### Analogy

* DNA = Cookbook
* mRNA = Photocopy of one recipe
* Ribosome = Chef
* Amino acids = Ingredients
* Protein = Finished dish

---

## 3. Protein Synthesis Mechanics

### DNA → mRNA (Transcription)

* RNA polymerase binds gene, unzips DNA, creates complementary RNA strand.

### Ribosomes

* Made of proteins + rRNA
* Two subunits: small (reads mRNA), large (links amino acids)

### Translation Mechanism

1. Ribosome reads mRNA codons.
2. tRNA delivers matching amino acids.
3. Ribosome links amino acids via peptide bonds.
4. Stop codon reached → protein released.

### Codons

* 3 bases = 1 amino acid
* Sequence of codons dictates amino acid order → correct protein sequence.

### DNA in New Cells

* DNA not made of proteins, but packaged with histones.
* DNA replication uses DNA polymerase: semi-conservative replication.
* Each new cell gets a complete, identical copy of DNA.

---

## 5. DNA Differences Between Individuals

* Different alleles → different proteins → different traits (e.g., eye color).
* DNA has two separate processes:

  1. Replication → copy DNA
  2. Protein synthesis → build proteins according to gene sequence

## 6. mRNA Vaccines (Moderna)

```

       │
       │ Enters cytoplasm (lipid nanoparticle)
       ▼

       │
Amino acids linked → Viral protein (spike)
       │
Immune system recognizes protein → Antibodies + memory
```

* No DNA entry
* Temporary protein production
* Immune system trained for viral infection

### Analogy

* DNA = Cookbook (unchanged)
* Synthetic mRNA = Photocopy of foreign recipe
* Ribosome = Chef
* Dish = Viral spike protein

## 7. mRNA vs Gene Editing (CRISPR)

| Feature         | mRNA vaccine              | CRISPR / Gene Editing      |
| --------------- | ------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Target          | Ribosomes                 | DNA in nucleus             |
| Purpose         | Temporary protein         | Permanent DNA change       |
| Mechanism       | mRNA → ribosome → protein | Guide RNA + Cas9 → cut DNA |
| DNA interaction | None                      | Direct editing             |

### CRISPR Mechanism

```
DNA double helix
       │
Guide RNA (gRNA) matches sequence
       ▼
Cas9 binds gRNA → scans DNA
       │
Cas9 cuts DNA at target site
       │
Cell repair machinery fixes → DNA altered
```

### mRNA Delivery for CRISPR

* Synthetic mRNA encodes Cas9 + gRNA
* Ribosome produces Cas9 enzyme
* Cas9 + gRNA cuts DNA → permanent change

### Analogy

* mRNA vaccine = chef cooks dish, cookbook unchanged
* mRNA CRISPR = chef makes scissors, cuts cookbook → recipe altered

## FAQ: Common Questions

### Where are chromosomes located?
Chromosomes are located in the **nucleus** of eukaryotic cells. Each cell nucleus contains a complete set of chromosomes (23 pairs in humans). During cell division, chromosomes condense and become visible under a microscope.

### Is the full DNA of a human present in stem cells?
**Yes**, stem cells contain the complete human genome (all 23 chromosome pairs). However, different genes are activated or silenced depending on the cell type and developmental stage. Stem cells have the potential to become any cell type because they can activate different sets of genes.

### How does the human body grow? Is gene activation/deactivation controlled by DNA?
Human growth involves **gene regulation** - turning genes on/off at specific times:

- **DNA contains regulatory sequences** that control when genes are expressed
- **Hormones act as signals** that trigger gene activation (e.g., puberty hormones activate growth and development genes)
- **Environmental factors** and **developmental timing** influence which genes are active
- **Gene expression changes** throughout life stages (infancy → childhood → puberty → adulthood)

**Example**: During puberty, hormonal signals activate genes responsible for:
- Growth spurts (growth hormone genes)
- Secondary sexual characteristics (sex hormone-responsive genes)
- Brain development (neural development genes)

The DNA sequence remains the same, but **which genes are "read" and made into proteins changes** based on cellular signals and developmental programs.
