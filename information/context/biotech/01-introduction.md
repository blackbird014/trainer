# Biotech Investment Pipeline - Introduction

## Overview

This document outlines the biotech investment pipeline, mapping the flow from sequencing technologies through AI/bioinformatics to synthetic biology platforms and their market applications. We track the value chain from data generation to commercial deployment across multiple sectors with a combined total addressable market (TAM) of $150–200B+.

## Pipeline Structure

| Stage | Representative companies | Core function | Market focus / TAM |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Sequencing | Illumina (ILMN), PacBio (PACB), Oxford Nanopore (ON) | Provides DNA / RNA sequencing and biological data | Inputs foundational data for downstream design and engineering |
| AI / Bioinformatics | Recursion (RXRX), Insitro (private), Tempus (private), AlphaFold (DeepMind/Google) | Uses AI to analyze data and design/simulate molecules, proteins, genetic circuits | Accelerates discovery; reduces cost/time to candidate selection |
| Synthetic Biology Platforms | Ginkgo Bioworks (DNA), Moderna (MRNA), CRISPR Therapeutics (CRSP), Editas (EDIT), Amyris (historic) | Engineers organisms and biological systems (yeast, bacteria, algae; mRNA, CRISPR) | Enables scalable production and therapeutic delivery |
| Market Applications | Food & Flavors; Alt-proteins / Dairy; Agriculture; Materials / Bioplastics; Pharma / Therapeutics | Commercialize products across sectors | Indicative TAMs: Food & Flavors ~$1–2B; Alt-proteins / Dairy ~$20–30B; Agriculture ~$5–10B; Materials ~$10–15B; Pharma / Therapeutics $100B+; Total ~$150–200B+ |

## Key Investment Themes

### 🚀 **Why This Pipeline is Critical**
- **Data explosion**: Sequencing costs dropped 1,000,000x since 2000
- **AI breakthroughs**: Transformers, foundation models, AlphaFold
- **Capital efficiency**: In silico experiments cost pennies vs. $1000s for wet lab
- **Quantum computing**: Next frontier for molecular simulation

### 💡 **Catalysts to Watch**
1. **Interest rate cuts** → cheaper capital for R&D-heavy companies
2. **Quantum computing** → better molecular simulations (D-Wave, IBM, IonQ)
3. **Foundation models** → biotech equivalent of GPT for molecules
4. **Regulatory momentum** → FDA approving AI-designed drugs

### ⚠️ **Risks**
- Unproven clinical translation (AI predictions ≠ clinical success)
- Capital intensive (years until profitability)
- Competitive moat questions (can models be replicated?)
- Regulatory uncertainty for AI-designed therapeutics

## Market Opportunity

| Segment | Addressable Market |
|---------|-------------------|
| Drug Discovery (Software) | $5–10B |
| Pharma R&D Spend (Total) | $200B+ |
| Precision Medicine | $100B+ |

**Key Insight**: This pipeline doesn't just serve pharma—it enables synthetic biology platforms downstream, multiplying impact across food, materials, agriculture, etc.

## Pipeline Dependencies

The entire biotech pipeline is **interdependent**. Long-read sequencing, AI/bioinformatics, synthetic biology platforms, and market applications must all work together for any individual layer to succeed.

**Complete Chain:**
Sequencing (PacBio) → DNA Synthesis (TWST) → Enzyme Optimization (CDXS) → AI Design (RXRX) → Organism Engineering (Ginkgo) → Therapeutic Development (CRSP/EDIT) → Market
